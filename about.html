          Since my brother came home the first time from basic training, it was clear that one day I would follow in his footsteps.
          This goal accompanied me from my 7th year of life until April 2022, when I signed my contract to join the army as an officer cadet.
          Training started on 04.07.2022, and here I am now: an officer of the German Army Signal Corps.

          I like to spend my holidays rather... well, unconventional. Skydiving, hiking, climbing, expeditions, mountaineering, travelling, motorsports.
          Everything that other people call insane is on my list. If something sounds normal, I take it to a level where I convince people that it certainly is not.
